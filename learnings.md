## Day 4
- Python `list.index()` will give the location of the first occurence of an element in a list. It can be useful for getting the part of a list before and after a certain marker
- Python `list.count(a)` will count occurences of `a` in the list
- `[1,2,3]*3` will evaluate to `[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]`
- `frozenset` is a hashable but immutable type of `set`. In other words, `frozenset` can not be modified after creation but can be used for e.g. dict keys
- `math.gcd(*args)` for greatest divisor and `math.lcm(*args)` for least common multiple
- `math.prod(iterable)`. No need for `np.prod` and works on all iterables
